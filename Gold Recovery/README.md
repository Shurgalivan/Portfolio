# Gold Recovery Prediction using Machine Learning

## Objectives:

The project aims to develop a model that can optimize the production process and prevent the operation of the plant with unfavorable characteristics.

## Used Stack
- Python (version 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Findings
The developed prediction model based on the RandomForest algorithm demonstrated promising results. The model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.03 on the test dataset. The optimal hyperparameters used for the model are max_depth = 5 and n_estimators = 39.
