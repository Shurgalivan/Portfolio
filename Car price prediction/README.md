# Car Price Determination

## Stack Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- LightGBM

## Objectives:

This project aims to develop a model for determining the market value of used cars. The project involves preprocessing the data, training different models, and evaluating their performance based on prediction time and the RMSE metric.


## Findings

- The Passive Agressive regression model outperformed other models in terms of prediction time and RMSE metric.
- The model was successfully trained and evaluated, providing accurate predictions of used car prices.
- The preprocessing steps, including feature selection, missing value handling, and encoding, contributed to improved model performance.
