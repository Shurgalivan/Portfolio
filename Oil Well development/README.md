# Oil Well Development Analysis

## Overview
The goal of this project is to determine the optimal region for oil well development based on machine learning models and risk analysis.

## Stack Used
The project utilizes the following stack:
- Python
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression)
- Data analysis and visualization libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Key Findings
The key findings of the project include:
- Three regions were explored, and a linear regression model was trained to predict the oil reserves and estimate profits.
- After analyzing the data, it was found that the third region showed the highest explored reserves with the lowest risk coefficient.
- However, the second region had a higher average profit despite having a higher risk coefficient.
- Expert assessment by geologists is recommended to validate the findings and provide additional insights.
