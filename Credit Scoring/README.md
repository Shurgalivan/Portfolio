# Loan Borrowers' Creditworthiness/Credit Scorring Analysis

## Stack Used:

- Python
- Pandas

## Objectives:

The objective of this project was to investigate whether marital status and the number of children have an impact on the timely repayment of loans. The dataset provided by the bank included information on the creditworthiness of borrowers.

The findings of the analysis are crucial for the development of a credit scoring model.  

## Findings

The analysis of loan borrowers' creditworthiness revealed the following insights:

- Clients with more children tend to have a slightly lower proportion of overdue payments.
- Marital status plays a role in loan repayment, with married clients or those who have previously been married demonstrating a lower proportion of overdue payments compared to unmarried clients.
- There is no clear association between income level and the likelihood of timely loan repayment.
- The purpose of the loan has an impact on loan repayment, with car loans and loans for education exhibiting a higher proportion of clients with overdue payments, while mortgages appear to be the least risky category with a lower proportion of problematic clients.
