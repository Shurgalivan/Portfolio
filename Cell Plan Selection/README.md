# Cell Plan Seceltion Research

## Stack Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy

## Objectives:

To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department of a federal telecommunications operator has commissioned a comparative study of two tariffs to determine which one generates more revenue. You have at your disposal the data of 500 users of the operator: who they are, where they are from, which tariff they use, and how many calls and messages each user sent in 2018. It is necessary to analyze the behavior of the customers and draw a conclusion about which tariff is better.

## Findings

Based on the hypothesis testing conducted, we can draw the following conclusions:

- Average revenue between "Ultra" and "Smart" tariff users is found to be significantly different. We reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a statistically significant difference in revenue between the two tariff plans.

- However, regarding the hypothesis testing on revenue between users from Moscow and users from other cities, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is not enough evidence to support the claim that users from Moscow generate significantly more revenue than users from other cities.
