# Customer Churn Prediction in Beta Bank

## Stack Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy
- Scikit-Learn

## Objectives:

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in Beta Bank, a fictional bank. The objective is to develop a model that accurately predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the bank in the near future. The project utilizes data analysis, machine learning, and data science techniques to achieve this goal.


## Findings

The project successfully developed a predictive model for customer churn prediction in Beta Bank. Here are the key findings:

Class imbalance significantly impacted the model's performance, leading to lower precision and recall metrics.
Balancing techniques such as class weight balancing and upsampling helped improve the model's performance and address class imbalance.
The Random Forest model consistently outperformed the other models, both on the weighted and upsampled datasets.
The selected model demonstrated excellent performance on the test dataset, achieving the desired F1 score and high accuracy and AUC-ROC metrics.
The precision and recall metrics exhibited a balanced trade-off, indicating a reliable prediction of both positive and negative churn instances.
Overall, this project highlights the importance of handling class imbalance and utilizing appropriate techniques to improve the predictive performance of customer churn models. The insights gained from this project can aid Beta Bank in identifying customers at risk of churn, enabling proactive measures to retain them.
