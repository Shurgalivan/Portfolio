# Real estate market research: a study of apartment sales advertisements

## Stack Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Objectives:

This research project aimed to determine the market value of real estate properties using a dataset from a real estate sales service. The dataset consisted of advertisements for apartment sales in Saint Petersburg and neighboring areas over several years. The goal was to establish parameters that would enable the development of an automated system capable of detecting anomalies and fraudulent activities.

## Findings

- Parameters: The dataset provided two types of data for each listed apartment: user-entered information and automatically obtained information based on cartographic data. These additional parameters, such as the distance to the city center, airport, nearest park, and body of water, proved valuable in determining market value.
- Correlation with Price: The analysis revealed that certain factors had a significant impact on property prices. These factors included the overall area, number of rooms, and proximity to the city center. The larger the area and the closer the property was to the city center, the higher the price tended to be.
- Sale Duration: The research showed that the average time it took to sell a property was relatively long, and selling a property within 90 days was considered a success. However, it should be noted that the removal of an advertisement from a platform does not necessarily indicate a successful sale, as there could be various reasons for the removal.
- Limitations: The research acknowledges the limitations of relying on user-entered data and the validity of conclusions drawn from the dataset. The accuracy and reliability of the user-entered information can vary, and the analysis considered correlations between parameters in isolation, rather than considering their combined effects.
